## RL Lesson 1: Basic Concepts

### Terms

* State : The status of agent with respect to the environment

* State space : The set of all states

* Action space : The set of all possible actions in a state

  `different states have different action space`

* Deterministic or Stochastic state transition : states connected by action

* Policy : tells the agent what action to take at a state

  `using Mathematical representation(conditional probability) to describe policy`
